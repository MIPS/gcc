Add
-mgrow-frame-downwards
#


#

Grow
the
local
frame
down
instead
of
up
for
mips16
code
size.
#


#

By
growing
the
frame
downwards
we
get
spill
slots
created
at
the
lowest
#

address
rather
than
highest
address
in
a
local
frame.
The
benefit
being
#

that
when
the
frame
is
large
the
spill
slots
can
still
be
accessed
using
#

a
16bit
instruction
whereas
it
is
less
important
for
large
local
variables
#

to
be
accessed
using
short
instructions
as
they
are
(probably)
accessed
#

less
frequently
#


#

This
is
default
on
for
MIPS16.
