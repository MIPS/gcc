	Back port from mainline
	2013-08-01  Fabien Chêne  <fabien@gcc.gnu.org>

	PR c++/54537
	* cp-tree.h: Check OVL_USED with OVERLOAD_CHECK.
	* name-lookup.c (do_nonmember_using_decl): Make sure we have an
	OVERLOAD before calling OVL_USED. Call diagnose_name_conflict
	instead of issuing an error without mentioning the conflicting
	declaration.
