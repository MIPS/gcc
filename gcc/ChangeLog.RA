	ra_debug_insns, ra_debug_bbi, ra_print_rtl_with_bb): My version of
	pretty-printing RTL.  Use them in the various dumps.

	(ra_alloc, ra_calloc): New.  Use the ra_obstack for allocating memory.
	Use it everywhere, where small objects were allocated by xmalloc
	or xcalloc.  At the same time never free that memory while working,
	but simply forget it.  Instead it's freed once at the end of reg_alloc.

	-- Optimisations for graph building --
	(update_regnos_mentioned, livethrough_conflicts_bb, init_bb_info,
	free_bb_info, live_in_edge): New.  Handle use-transparent blocks.
	(live_in): Don't use prev_real_insn(), too many function calls.
	Call live_in_edge() for handling basic block boundaries, which has
	optimisations, when the entered block is transparent for the use in
	question.
	(build_web_parts_and_conflicts): Don't allocate copy_cache here,
	nor the per basic block info.
	Call update_regnos_mentioned() for conservative detection of
	transparency.  Don't trace uses of fixed registers.  Only trace new
	or marked uses.  Call livethrough_conflicts_bb for dealing with
	transparent uses/blocks.

	-- Incremental building of interference graph --
	(init_one_web_common, reinit_one_web, reset_lists, reset_conflicts,
	realloc_web_parts, detect_web_parts_to_rebuild): New.

	(init_one_web_common): Old init_one_web.  Initialize also
	dlink.  Put web directly in the correct list.
	(init_one_web): Simply memset() everything, then call
	init_one_web_common.
	(reinit_one_web): Clears only necessary members.  Deal with
	new members.
	(init_web_parts): Sanity checks.  Sometimes clear web_parts[].ref
	member (incremental building).
	(parts_to_webs): Break out in parts_to_webs_1 and init_webs_defs_uses.
	Generally deal with incremental building.  Reuse free webs.
	Create artifical inverse webs.  use2web[] and def2web[] now contain
	the subwebs instead of webs.  All users of those arrays changed.
	(conflicts_between_webs): Use reset_conflicts() for later passes for
	incremental building.  Cache already created conflicts. 
	(alloc_mem): Use mostly realloc_web_parts.  Only allocate
	move_handled and insn_df[] (per create_insn_info) each round.
	(free_mem): Similar.  Don't free all memory here, but ...
	(free_all_mem): ... here.

	-- Interference region spilling --
	(build_inverse_webs, spill_same_color_p, is_partly_live_1,
	update_spill_colors, spill_is_free, emit_loads,
	detect_bbs_for_rewrite, detect_deaths_in_bb, reloads_to_loads,
	rewrite_program2): New.  Interference region spilling.
	
	(remember_slot, slots_overlap_p, delete_overlapping_slots,
	slot_member_p, insert_stores): New.  Emit stores slightly more
	clever than after each def.
	
	-- Rematerialisation --
	(memref_is_stack_slot, contains_pseudo, want_to_remat,
	detect_remat_webs):  New.  Detect rematerializable webs.
	Set web->pattern to the source rtx.  Emit that instead of a reload
	in emit_loads() later.
	
	(delete_useless_defs): New.  Delete insns which defined
	rematerializable webs which got spilled, and are now useless.
	(spill_coalescing): Don't coalesce rematerializable webs.  Update
	savings due to insns deleting.

	-- Local spill cost improvements --
	(spill_prop_savings, spill_prop_insert, spill_propagation,
	spill_coalprop): New.  Spill propagation and integration with
	spill coalescing.
	(try_recolor_web, recolor_spills): New.  Recoloring spilled
	webs if neighbors can be colored differently or spilled and that's
	cheaper.

	(actual_spill): Use spill_coalprop(), choose_spill_colors(),
	rewrite_program2(), insert_stores(), delete_useless_defs() and
	detect_web_parts_to_rebuild().

	-- Optimistic coalescing / coalesce breaking --
	(insert_coalesced_conflicts, comp_webs_maxcost,
	restore_conflicts_from_coalesce, unalias_web, copy_conflict_list,
	init_web_pairs, add_web_pair_cost, comp_web_pairs,
	sort_and_combine_web_pairs, aggressive_coalesce,
	aggressive_coalesce_2, extended_coalesce, extended_coalesce_2,
	check_uncoalesced_moves): New.  Optimistically coalesce
	nonconflicting webs.
	
	(add_conflict_edge): Remember current conflict list when needed.
	Update num_conflicts only when other web has correct type. (coalesce
	breaking)
	(moves_to_webs): Only fill web's moves list, when
	!flag_ra_optimistic_coalescing.  Otherwise that member isn't needed.
	This way no iterated coalescing is done at all when we want optimistic
	coalescing.
	(combine): Can combine webs with any type.  Merge spill cost
	into coalesce target of requested.  Merge _all_ conflicts
	into coalesce target (not only non-selected non-coalesced).
	
	-- Various stuff --
	(remember_web_was_spilled): Use hard_regs_count.  Maintain
	orig_usable_regs.  Web doesn't yet have any neighbors.
	(detect_spill_temps): Better classification of when webs can't be
	spilled, or are spill-temps but _can_ be spilled.
	(determine_web_costs): New.  Broken out of parts_to_webs.  Correctly
	calculate spill costs in terms of basic-block frequency (although
	this seems wrong sometimes).
	(make_webs): Use detect_remat_webs() and determine_web_costs().
	(put_web): Use web_lists[] instead of a directly named list header.
	(decrement_degree): Use remove_web_from_list.
	(combine): In case of partial conflicts try to find a corresponding
	part in the target.  Relax spill_temp flag when combining
	constrained with less constrained webs.
	(default_spill_heuristic): Coalesced webs are cheaper.  Prefer also
	webs spanning more deaths.
	(color_usable_p, get_biased_reg): New.  Checks if a certain color
	is usable for a web, and get a available color for a web,
	prefering biased colors.
	(calculate_dont_begin): New.  Detect colors which are forbidden
	as begin colors for a web according to already colored neighbors.
	Broken out from ...
	(colorize_one_web): ... here.  Use calculate_dont_begin.  Try to
	use the color this web got the last round first.  Then try biased
	colors.  Better and more methods to respill neighbors for
	spill_temps or non-spills.  Maintain bias_colors for neighbors when
	requested.  When optimistic coloring already break coalescings for
	spilled webs here and recolor.
	(rewrite_program): Maintain cost variables.  Swap order of
	load and store emitting.  Emit uses here only if
	flag_ra_spill_every_use.  Emit stores only when a stack-slot was
	allocated.  Now not called anymore.  Stores are emitted by
	insert_stores.
	(one_pass): If requested call aggressive_coalesce() and
	extended_coalesce_2().  Use dump_igraph_machine().  Check the
	graph after coloring (check_colors()), break any remaining coalesces
	to spills if reqeusted and try to recolor spilled
	webs (recolor_spills).
	(dump_constraints): Temporarily change final colors into pseudo
	rtx's.  Call constrain_operands() to check if the insns already
	strictly match, or not.
	(init_ra): Don't add eliminable registers into never_use_colors.
	Reload will fix this up, if it's finally not usable.
	Initialize byte2bitcount[], hardregs_for_mode[], insns_with_deaths
	and ra_obstack.
	(setup_renumber): Free ra_reg_renumber only if necessary.
	(reg_alloc): Initialize debug level to some usefull values.
	Call regclass() here (instead in toplev.c).  Reset some global
	vars.

	* Makefile.in (ra.o): Add reload.h o the dependencies.
	* ra.c: Include reload.h, so MEMORY_MOVE_COST is always defined.

2001-08-15  Daniel Berlin  <dan@cgsoftware.com>

	* ra.c (splits_init): New function, initialize split data
	structures/determine costs in terms of loads/stores.
	(rematerializable): Handle reg_defs properly.
	(parts_to_webs): Calculate spill cost on our own, taking remat
	into account.
	(init_one_web): Init spill cost to 0 now that we calculate it on
	our own.
	(struct split_range): New struct, keeping track of stores/loads
	needed for live ranges.
	(reg_alloc): Don't call reg_scan and regclass at the end, they
	screw reg_renumber.

	* df.[ch]: Use sbitmaps for reaching uses/defs instead of bitmaps.
	The kill set is greedily set, so it's very very dense, and we waste 
	memory/time using bitmaps for it.

	* gcse.c: Begin to fix store motion, global store elimination
	works okay now. 

2001-08-07  Daniel Berlin  <dan@cgsoftware.com>

	* ra.c (get_free_reg): Revert Denis's change, it caused subregs to
	get allocated to registers of the wrong mode on SPARC. I don't
	believe it's correct.
	(rewrite_program): Mark modified insns with df_insn_modify.
	Properly emit pseudos for rematerialized things, if possible, 
	in order to split our live range.
	Move definition of df to top of file, making it global, so we can
	stop passing it around for no good reason.
	
	* df.c (df_insn_modify): Grow the UID table if necessary, rather
	than assume all emits go through df_insns_modify.

	Add dj graph stuff for loop finding/block depth (hopefully will be
	moved to flow.c at some point)
	(find_nesting_depths): New function.
	(dominates): New function.
	(DFS_DJ_graph): New function.

2001-08-06  Daniel Berlin  <dan@cgsoftware.com>

	Mainline merge of gcc stuff, fixes a bunch of flow bugs that had
	been fixed, etc.
	
	* ra.c (reg_alloc): Do only what is necessary for life analysis,
	rather than PROP_FINAL and whatnot.
	Also, fix all the comparison warnings and such.
	

2001-08-06  Daniel Berlin  <dan@cgsoftware.co>

	* gcse.c (gcse_main): Disable store motion, it's completely broken
	in it's current state.
	(simple_mem): Undo #if 0'ing, since we never seem to move loads who
	address varies *anyway*.

	* ra.c (reg_alloc): Ditto.
	
Sun Aug  5 14:16:46 2001  Denis Chertykov  <denisc@overta.ru>

        Restore ra.c version 1.1.2.28

	* ra.c (reg_alloc): Correct `max_regno' after rescan registers
	preferences. 

2001-08-03  Daniel Berlin  <dan@cgsoftware.com>

	* ra.c (coalesce): Comment out conservative test, in preparation
	for optimistic coalescing. Also fixes x86 (though this is a side
	effect). 

Wed Aug  1 23:40:05 2001  Denis Chertykov  <denisc@overta.ru>

	* ra.c (undef_to_bitmap): Handle more variants of *undefined.

Wed Aug  1 23:35:02 2001  Denis Chertykov  <denisc@overta.ru>

	* ra.c (combine): combine add_hardregs's of U and V.
	(ok): Remove check for combining a web with a precolored web.
	Check a precolored web for usable_regs.

	(rewrite_program): Since we always call `regclass' if
	`changed' we can emit a new pseudos which will have a new reg
	class preferences.

Mon Jul 30 20:21:07 2001  Denis Chertykov  <denisc@overta.ru>

	* ra.c (get_free_reg): Wrong test removed.
	(reg_alloc): Fix formatting.

2001-07-29  Daniel Berlin  <dan@cgsoftware.com>

	Add support for simple rematerialization (not lattice based right
	now, very trivial, but already has a large positive impact).

	* ra.c (rematerializable): New function. Determine if a value is
	rematerializable. 
	(parts_to_webs): If it's rematerializable, modify the spill cost
	to be the cost of rematerializing the RTL in question.
	(rewrite_program): If we can rematerialize, do it.
	(toplevel): New variable, emitted_remat.
	(dump_ra): Print out number of rematerializations.

	* df.c (df_rd_global_compute): Add successors to worklist, not
	current item.
	(df_ru_global_compute): Ditto.
	
	* df.[ch]: Update to mainline, which contains fixes for register 
	liveness over calls.

2001-07-26  Daniel Berlin  <dan@cgsoftware.com>

	* gcse.c: Use rtl_dump_file instead of gcse_file, remove gcse_file, 
	and parameter file to gcse_main.
	(build_store_vectors): Take st_antloc into account as well.
	
	* rtl.h: Change gcse_main prototype.

	* toplev.c: Don't pass file to gcse_main.

	* ra.c : (default_spill_heuristic): Add one to num_conflicts, 
	so that a web with 0 conflicts doesn't have a 0 spill cost.
	(init_one_web): If we don't think we have any registers we can put
	this thing in, ever, something is wrong, so abort (I.E. if
	web->num_freedom == 0, abort)
	(reg_alloc): Call reg_scan_update and regclass if stuff changed,
	since we'll have more registers now.

	* regclass.c (reg_scan_mark_refs): When we increase REG_N_SETS,
	increase REG_N_REFS (like flow does), so that regclass doesn't
	think a reg is useless, and thus, not calculate a class, when it
	really should have.

	* flow.c (propagate_block): When prev is null, but we haven't hit
	the beginning of the block, we crash.  So just set prev to
	something other than null at the start, and stop if it becomes
	null. I think this is just a symptom of some *other* problem,
	but I can't figure out what it is.
	

2001-07-25  Daniel Berlin  <dan@cgsoftware.com>

	* gcse.c: Store motion stuff from patch submitted to mainline.

	* ra.c: Call store motion when we are done.

2001-07-20  Daniel Berlin  <dan@cgsoftware.com>

	* params.def: Turn the C++ inlining default down like it is on the
	mainline and 3.0 branch, so we can work with C++ and have
	reasonable compile times.

	* ra.c (hardregset_to_string): You meant HOST_WIDE_INT_PRINT_HEX,
	not "%x".  Also, just increase the static string length to avoid
	overflow, as well.
	Fixes crash on powerpc.

2001-07-20  Michael Matz <matzmich@cs.tu-berlin.de>

         (colorize_one_web): Use call_used_reg_set as preference.
         (init_ra): arg,frame,stack pointers can use few hard regs.

2001-02-24  Michael Matz  <matzmich@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	* ra.c (conflicts_between_webs): new function, split out from ...
	(parts_to_webs): ... here, new argument part2web.  Change callers.
	(make_webs): new function, calling the above in the right order;
	partly split out from ...

	(everywhere): format some comments.

2001-02-23  Michael Matz  <matzmich@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	(init_one_web): base spill_cost on reg_spill_cost().
	(colorize_one_web): More Bad Web (tm) handling.  Now recursively
	trying to spill already colored long neighbors to prevent spilling
	short living Bad Webs.
	(everywhere): some commentary, finally merged Daniel's changes,
	so there exists one ra.c now ;).

	\sum_i(8^{loop_depth(i)}), with i all uses/defs.
	(colorize_one_web): Try even more hard not to spill a short live

	more than one source/dest.
	(get_free_reg): return only last_resort, if really no other reg found.

2001-02-02  Daniel Berlin  <dberlin@redhat.com>

	* new-regalloc.c: Use debug_msg in rest of places.
	(adjacent): Fix same type of traversal through regset problem.
	(is_reg_candidate): Also a reg candidate if it has a use.

2001-02-02  Geert Bosch  <bosch@gnat.com)

	* new-regalloc.c: Add debug_msg to output based on debug_regalloc
	level, clean up some of the if+fprintf pairs to use it instead.

2001-02-02  Daniel Berlin  <dberlin@redhat.com>

	* new-regalloc.c: Add warning about something i learned the hard
	way using the hashed sets. This is part of the preparation for

	or libiberty.
	

2001-02-02  Daniel Berlin  <dberlin@redhat.com>

	* new-regalloc.c: Large amount of variable renaming and formatting
	fixups. Hope i caught them all.

2001-02-01  Richard Henderson  <rth@redhat.com>

	* new-regalloc.c (assign_regs): Insert missing "else" between
	biased and non-biased code.  Try the preferred register class
	before the alternate register class, not at the same time.

2001-02-01  Richard Henderson  <rth@redhat.com>

	* toplev.c (NEW_REGISTER_ALLOCATOR): Remove.
	(dump_file_index, dump_file): Remove lreg dump file.

	(find_move_cost): Fix cost calculation.
	

	* new-regalloc.c (coalesce): Fixed test for constrainedness.
	(top level): Include new-regalloc.h

2001-01-31  Daniel Berlin  <dberlin@redhat.com>

	* new-regalloc.c (precolored_OK): Fix heuristic.
	(reg_freedom): Cache register freedoms, they don't change.
	(find_reg_given_constraints): Remove backwards direction, it's useless.
	(assign_regs): Start to implement biased coloring.
	(*): Dump debug info to rtl_dump_file, rather than stderr.

2001-01-30  Daniel Berlin  <dberlin@redhat.com>

	* new-regalloc.c (perform_new_regalloc_init): Handle fixed
	registers, as they interfere with everything
	(OK): rename to precolored_OK.
	(precolored_OK): Handle fixed registers, since we can't
	coalesce them with anything.

2001-01-20  Richard Henderson  <rth@redhat.com>

	* new-regalloc.c: Canonicalize formatting.

2001-01-29  Daniel Berlin  <dberlin@redhat.com>

	* ssa.c  (mark_phi_and_copy_regs): Test rtx against 0, not NULL,
	and test pattern against 0 too.
	
	* reload1.c (finish_spills): Call find_reg_given_constraints
	rather than retry_global_alloc.

	* df.c (df_insn_regno_def_p): Reverse return values so that it
	does what the function says it does, so that dataflow analysis of
	call clobbered registers works.

	* new-regalloc.h: Add definitions of external functions, stop
	including other files.
	
	* new-regalloc.c: Move inclusion of those files to here.
	(perform_new_regalloc_init): Fix data flow analysis problem.
	(rewrite_program): Change call to reload to tell it we are calling
	from the global register allocator, now that it calls the right
	retry routine.

2001-01-29  Daniel Berlin  <dberlin@redhat.com>

	* new-regalloc.c (find_reg_given_constraints): Fix the *other* bug
	in spilling, causing things taking up > 1 register to be spilled
	if register 0 was free. Duh. (The arguments to x_okay_in_direction
	were off by one).
	(conservative): freedom would be max of the reg_freedom's of the
	lhs and rhs, not the max of the size of the preferred class of
	each (though it's close).

2001-01-28  Daniel Berlin  <dberlin@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.in (STAGE1_CFLAGS): Remove -O3, sorry about that.

	* new-regalloc.c (find_reg_given_constraints): Fix bug in spilling
	(notOK isn't used anymore).
	Pass mode along to x_okay_in_direction.
	(x_okay_in_direction): Add mode argument, use it.
	(find_costliest_move): Fix REGISTER_MOVE_COST call so that it has
	proper arguments.

Sun Jan 28 21:11:10 2001  Denis Chertykov  <denisc@overta.ru>

	* new-regalloc.c (find_reg_given_constraints): test result with
	`HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.

	* new-regalloc.h: add `#include "tm_p.h"'
	
2001-01-28  Daniel Berlin  <dberlin@redhat.com>

	* sbitmap.h (EXECUTE_IF_SET_IN_SBITMAP_REV): New macro, needed for
	dataflow analysis.
	(sbitmap_realloc): New function definition.

	* sbitmap.c (sbitmap_realloc): New function, change size of an
	already-allocated sbitmap.

	* toplev.c (rest_of_compilation): Stop calling old allocators,
	call new allocator instead.

	* rtl.h: Add reg_spill_cost definition.

	* reload1.c: De-staticify alter_reg.

	* reload.h: Make alter_reg externally visible (probably need it
	for spill code insertion).

	* new-regalloc.[ch]: New files. New register allocator.

	* df.[ch]: New files. Dataflow analysis.

	* local-alloc.c: Make update_equiv_regs non-static, we need it in
	the new allocator.

	* Makefile.in (OBJS): Add df.o, new-regalloc.o

	* regclass.c (regclass): Don't free costs, need it for spill costs.
	(reg_spill_cost): New function, give us cost if we have to
	put the register in memory.
