/* A table describing all the processors GCC knows about.  The first
   mention of an ISA level is taken as the canonical name for that
   ISA.

   To ease comparison, please keep this table in the same order
   as GAS's mips_cpu_info_table.  Please also make sure that
   MIPS_ISA_LEVEL_SPEC and MIPS_ARCH_FLOAT_SPEC handle all -march
   options correctly.

   Before including this file, define a macro:

   MIPS_CPU (NAME, CPU, ISA, FLAGS)

   where the arguments are the fields of struct mips_cpu_info.  */
