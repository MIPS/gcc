2007-03-03  Christopher D. Rickett  <crickett@lanl.gov>

	* decl.c: Updated verify_c_interop_param to include
	procedures.  Report an error for BIND(C) derived types that are
	found conclusively to not be C interoperable (warnings still allow
	derived types to be C interoperable).  Added checks to
	verify_bind_c_sym to make sure functions do not return arrays or
	strings and if the BIND(C) symbol is PRIVATE, a warning is
	reported if a binding label was given.  Updated gfc_match_bind_c
	to allow for NAME="".
	* gfortran.h: Added mod_name field to gfc_gsymbol to
	allow gfc_verify_binding_labels to correctly catch binding label
	collisions that are in separate modules in separate files if
	something uses both modules.
	* resolve.c: Updated verify_bind_c_sym in
	resolve_contained_functions to be called for both functions and
	subroutines.  Added resolve_bind_c_derived_types so the components
	of derived types can be tested once, rather than for each time it
	is encountered in a variable declaration.  Updated
	gfc_verify_binding_labels to ensure binding labels do not collide
	even if they're in separate modules (in separate files) and then
	used together in one namespace.  Set the module name for the
	gfc_gsymbol for the BIND(C) symbol to enable this checking.
	Changed the way BIND(C) derived types are verified during
	resolution to not call verify_bind_c_derived_type unless the user
	needs it to be BIND(C) (C interoperable) but did not mark it as
	such.
	* trans-decl.c: Added check to
	gfc_sym_mangled_identifier to see if a binding label was provided
	for a BIND(C) symbol.
	* parse.c: Removed call to verify_bind_c_derived_type
	that was in parse_derived.  This is now done during resolution in
	resolve_bind_c_derived_types.

	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_10_main.f03: New
	test case to make sure the compiler catches binding label
	collisions across separate files when they're use associated into
	one namespace.
	* gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_7.f03: New test case to
	make sure gfortran reports an error for BIND(C) procedures that
	try to return an array or character string.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_11_main.f03: Same
	type of test case as binding_label_tests_10, but for contained
	procedures.
	* gfortran.dg/interop_params.f03: The warning for
	my_type is now an error (missing BIND(C) in derived type
	definition).
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_10.f03: New test
	case that goes with binding_labels_10_main.f03.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_11.f03: New test
	case that goes with binding_labels_11_main.f03.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_2.f03: Updated
	test case to remove the error for a NAME="" specifier.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests.f03: Updated test
	case to include a NAME="" specifier, since this is valid.
	* gfortran.dg/bind_c_dts_3.f03: Updated my_c_type_1
	to an error from a warning.
	* gfortran.dg/bind_c_dts_4.f03: Test case to make
	sure the warnings for derived types are only printed once.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_9.f03: New test
	case that ensures gfortran reports a warning if a private variable
	that is BIND(C) is given a binding label.

2007-02-27  Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>

	* symbol.c (gfc_add_is_bind_c): Add symbol name as argument.
	(gfc_copy_attr): Update gfc_add_is_bind_c call.
	* fortran/decl.c (match_attr_spec,set_verify_bind_c_sym,
	gfc_match_suffix,gfc_match_subroutine,gfc_get_type_attr_spec): Ditto.
	* gfortran.h: Update gfc_add_is_bind_c prototype.

	* symbol.c (check_conflict): Allow bind(c) for procedural
	  dummy arguments.

2007-02-26  Christopher D. Rickett  <crickett@lanl.gov>

	* gfortran.dg/test_bind_c_parens.f03: New test case
	to make sure gfortran requires the parens for a subroutine that is
	marked BIND(C).
	* gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_5.f03: New test case to
	verify that gfortran catches duplicate BIND(C) attributes.
	* gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_6.f03: New test case for
	BIND(C) attribute only being applied to variables or common blocks.
	* gfortran.dg/c_size_t_driver.c: Main program for
	c_size_t_test.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_2.f03: Updated
	expected error messages.
	* gfortran.dg/c_size_t_test.f03: New test case to
	verify that c_size_t equals sizeof(size_t).
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_3.f03: New test
	case for verifying that binding labels don't collide with other
	binding labels or global symbol names.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_4.f03: Ditto.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_5.f03: Ditto.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_6.f03: Ditto.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_7.f03: Ditto.
	* gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_8.f03: Ditto.
	* gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_3.f03: Whitespace.

	* symbol.c: Added check to gfc_add_is_bind_c to make
	sure the symbol isn't already marked as BIND(C).  Added flag to
	gfc_add_is_bind_c to say if the BIND(C) is coming from a procedure
	declaration.  Fixed whitespace.
	* decl.c: Removed call to gfc_add_is_bind_c from
	gfc_match_bind_c; the call is now in the routines that call
	gfc_match_bind_c. Added another check for preventing multiple
	identifiers for a BIND(C) that has a NAME= specifier (there was
	one case that wasn't being checked).  Split
	gfc_match_attr_spec_stmt into gfc_match_bind_c_stmt and
	gfc_match_proc_decl_stmt.  The two new functions are now called
	from parse.c.  Added error checking for BIND(C).  Improved error
	messages for gfc_match_bind_c.  Fixed whitespace.
	* gfortran.h: Updated prototype for
	gfc_add_is_bind_c.  Added a sym_name field to gfc_gsymbol for use
	with global symbols created for binding labels.
	* iso-c-binding.def: Set c_size_t equal to
	gfc_index_integer_kind because size_type_node is not set in time
	for gfc_init_kinds.
	* resolve.c: Added gfc_verify_binding_labels to
	report errors if binding labels collide with another binding label
	or global symbol name.
	* match.c: Improved gfc_match_name_C for better error
	reporting.
	* match.h: Removed gfc_match_attr_spec_stmt.  Added
	gfc_match_bind_c_stmt and gfc_match_proc_decl_stmt.
	* parse.c: Added calls to gfc_match_bind_c_stmt and
	gfc_match_proc_decl_stmt in decode_statement.

2007-02-21  Christopher D. Rickett  <crickett@lanl.gov>

	* fortran/decl.c: Ditto.

2007-02-21  Christopher D. Rickett  <crickett@lanl.gov>
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/c_loc_tests_2.f03: New test case for
	the c_loc function.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_implicit_vars.f03: New test
	case for warning user about implicitly typed variables if they
	need to be C interoperable.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/interop_params.f03: Updated test case
	to change the expected line of the warning messages.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_array_params.f03: New test case
	to verify that gfortran reports errors if the user declares
	assumed-shape or deferred-shape dummy arguments for a BIND(C)
	procedure.  Only assumed-size or explicitly-shaped arrays are
	allowed.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_dts_2.f03: New test case that
	shows gfortran accepting a BIND(C) derived type that contains
	another BIND(C) derived type.  This was previously reported as an
	error.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests_2.f03: New test
	case to verify that gfortran reports error messages for invalid
	binding labels (error in the NAME= specifier).
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/binding_label_tests.f03: New test case
	for verifying that gfortran accepts all valid binding labels.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_dts_3.f03: New test case for
	verifying that gfortran correctly checks BIND(C) derived types
	that are nested within another BIND(C) derived type for being C
	interoperable.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/iso_c_binding_rename_1_driver.c: Main
	program for the iso_c_binding_rename_1 test.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/iso_c_binding_rename_1.f03: New test
	case to check that gfortran allows the symbols in iso_c_binding to
	be renamed.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/iso_c_binding_rename_2_driver.c: Main
	program for the iso_c_binding_rename_2 test.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/iso_c_binding_rename_2.f03: New test
	case to check that gfortran allows the symbols in iso_c_binding to
	be renamed.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_dts_2_driver.c: Main program
	for the bind_c_dts_2 test case.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_2.f03: Updated test case.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/c_loc_tests_2_funcs.c: C functions
	that go with c_loc_tests_2.f03.
	* testsuite/gfortran.dg/bind_c_usage_3.f03: Updated test case.
	* fortran/symbol.c: Added warnings for implicitly typed
	variables that need to be C interoperable.  Added
	get_iso_c_binding_dt() for retrieving derived types from
	namespace, independent of the type name.  Changed
	verify_bind_c_derived_type to allow type components.  Updated
	warning/error messages in many cases to not use the *_now
	versions.  Removed dead code: gen_c_interop_kind_sym,
	gen_given_kinds, gen_c_interop_int_kinds,
	gen_c_interop_logical_kinds, gen_c_interop_real_kinds,
	gen_special_c_chars, gen_c_interop_char_kinds,
	gen_c_interop_ptr_syms, gen_c_interop_ptr_kinds, gen_iso_c_proc,
	gen_c_interop_int_funcs, gen_c_interop_kinds.  These were removed
	because they have not been necessary since FX added the
	generate_isocbinding_symbol function.  Updated functions to use
	the from_intmod and intmod_sym_id instead of the symbol names.
	This allows the symbols to be renamed by the user.  Added the
	derived types for c_ptr and c_funptr to the namespace
	derived_types list.
	* fortran/decl.c: Updated warning/error messages.  Added test
	cases for preventing assumed-shape and deferred-shape arrays as
	parameters to BIND(C) procedures.  Removed verification of C
	interoperability because it is now done during resolve_sym().
	Added an error check for binding labels where a name specifier was
	given with a zero lengthed string.
	* fortran/gfortran.h: Updated prototypes.
	* fortran/module.c: Added code to put from_intmod and
	intmod_sym_id in the module file.  This is needed to correctly
	recognize renamed iso_c_binding module symbols.
	* fortran/trans-types.c: Updated to use from_intmod and
	intmod_sym_id instead of the names for iso_c_binding symbols c_ptr
	and c_funptr.
	* fortran/resolve.c: Added test in resolve_contained_functions
	to verify the return type of functions that are BIND(C).  Use
	from_intmod and intmod_sym_id to recognize iso_c_binding symbols
	instead of their names.  Added checks to resolve_symbol to verify
	C interoperability for symbols that need to be.  This use to be
	done in decl.c, but it was pointed out that this could be too
	early to check.
	* fortran/match.c: Updated gfc_match_name_C to handle leading
	or trailing spaces in the name specifier.
	* fortran/match.h: Updated prototypes.  Moved some to
	gfortran.h.

2007-02-14  Tobias Burnus  <burnus@net-b.de>

	args for symbol name and location.  Slightly changed a couple
	warning messages.  Removed validation of C kind from
	gfc_match_kind_spec.  Added validation of C kind to
	verify_c_interop.  Removed the verification of C interoperability in  
	build_sym since it is done in variable_decl.  Modified checks on
	BIND(C) derived types to include errors for the definition and any
	variable declared with it.
	* fortran/gfortran.h: Changed the prototype for
	verify_c_interop to take args for the symbol/component name and
	location.  These are used for an error message if the validation
	of the C kind fails.

2007-01-21  Francois-Xavier Coudert  <coudert@clipper.ens.fr>

	* gfortran.h: Add new fields from_intmod and intmod_sym_id to the
	gfc_symbol structure, to keep track of symbols coming from
	intrinsic modules so we can special-case them when needed.
	* symbol.c (generate_isocbinding_symbol): Set these new fields.
	* module.c: Set these new fields, and use the fact that we know
	have a symbolic id per symbol to rework the code dealing with
	ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

2007-01-19  Christopher D. Rickett

	* decl.c: Fixed bugs in verifying BIND(C) variables
