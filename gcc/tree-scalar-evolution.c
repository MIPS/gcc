/* This pass analyses the evolution of induction variables in a loop.
   The algorithm is based on the SSA representation, and on the loop
   hierarchy tree.
   
   A short sketch of the algorithm is:
   
   - First step: gather the scalar variables that has to be analyzed.
   This is called the imperative list.  The minimal imperative list
   contains all the variables that are used in the exit conditions of
   the loop nest.  Other variables such as those used in array
   accesses are then enqueued on this list.
   
   - Second step: for each variable of the imperative list, analyze
   the dependences on other scalar variables in the loop nest.  The
   result is a scalar dependence graph.
   
   - Third step: establish a schedule for the IV analysis that
   satisfies all the dependences of the scalar dependence graph.
   
   - Fourth step: for each variable in the schedule, determine its
   initial condition and then its evolution in the loop nest.
   
   At the end of this analysis, an envelope chain of recurrence is
   associated to each variable of the imperative list.  If a variable
   has not been analyzed, the default answer of the analyzer is:
   "don't know", that corresponds to the [-oo, +oo] element of the
   lattice of intervals.
   
   FIXME: If on the first pass of the analyzer we have not scheduled
   some variables, it could be possible to further refine the
   knowledge base by calling again the analyzer with another
   imperative list.
   
   You can find a more detailed description of the algorithm in:
   http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/~pop/DEA_03_Pop.pdf
   http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/~pop/DEA_03_Pop.ps.gz.  But note that this
   is a preliminary report and some of the details of the algorithm
   might have changed.  I'm working on a research report that updates
   the description of the algorithm to reflect the design choices used
   in this implementation.
   
   FIXME: The following cases are not handled yet, and some of them
   produce rough approximations.  I suspect that these cases could be
   handled by a more precise analyzer.
   
   - FIXME wrap_around: The evolution is broken in a loop by an
   assignment under the form "a = x ..." with "x" beeing either a
   variable different from "a", or a constant.  Note that this case
   happens only in a loop that contains a loop-phi node for "a",
   otherwise the evolution is analyzed only in the inner loop avoiding
   the analysis of the evolution in this loop.  As an example,
   consider the following code:
   
   a_0 = 0
   b_0 = 0
   loop 
     a_1 = phi (a_0, a_4)
     b_1 = phi (b_0, b_2)
     a_2 = a_1 + 5
     a_3 = b_1 + 1
     a_4 = a_3 + 2
     b_2 = b_1 + 1
   endloop
   
   In this example the evolution of "a" is not {0, +, 3}, but {0, +,
   1}.  All the updating assignments "a = a + ..." should not update
   the evolution of "a" in this loop.
   
   The general solution for a wrap_around variable is: {x0 - y0, *, 0}
   + {y0, +, y1, +, y1}.  But this cannot be simplified into a single
   chrec for the moment: see Taylor's FIXME.
   
   - FIXME taylor: This FIXME concerns all the cases where we have to
   deal with additions of exponential functions: "exp + exp" or "poly
   + exp" or "cst + exp".  This could be handled by a Taylor
   decomposition of the exponential function, but is still under
   construction (not implemented yet) for the moment.
   
   - FIXME zero-trip-problem: This problem consists in determining the
   number of iterations in a loop.  Without such an information some
   cases could not be analyzed correctly.  As an example, consider the
   code:
   
   a = 0
   loop 
     a = a + 1
     loop i = 1, N, 1
       a = a + 2
     endloop
   endloop
   
   The evolution in the first loop is determined by the number of
   iterations in the inner loop.  In this case the inner loop runs N
   times, and the overall effect of the assignment "a = a + 2" from
   the inner loop is "a = a + 2*N".  Thus the evolution is: "a -> {{0,
   +, 2*N+1}_1, +, 2}_2".
   
   - FIXME floating-point: search for "case REAL_CST:".  This is just
   another extension that has to be implemented.  There are no
   difficulties except for the folding.  Do not fold the floating
   point operations, but let the trees grow up.  Using this unfolded
   form it is possible to analyze the numerical stability of the code
   in the loop...  Ref: "Static Analysis of the Numerical Stability of
   Loops" by Matthieu Martel.
   
   - FIXME analysis of mixers: This is one of the most difficult cases
   the analyzer has to deal with.  For the moment being, the analyzer
   answers with a rough approximation.

   - FIXME arithmetic flip-flop: As a mixer but flip-flops the values
   using arithmetic operations.
   
   - FIXME does this happen?  Some of the constructs of the underlying
   representation are not handled.  These cases may or may not happen.
   These FIXMEs can be solved only after the SSA representation is
   completely specified (with a grammar).
